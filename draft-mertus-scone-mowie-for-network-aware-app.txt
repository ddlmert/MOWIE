                  MoWIE for Network Aware Application

Abstract

   TODO: ADD ABSTRACT ONCE DRAFT IS COMPLETE - BASE OFF OF THE
   FOLLOWING: With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based
   interactive services such as cloud gaming have gained substantial
   attention.  To ensure users' quality of experience (QoE), a cloud
   interactive service may require not only high bandwidth (e.g., high-
   resolution media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency
   and low lagging).  However, the quality perceived by a user with
   mobile and wireless device may vary, as a function of many factors,
   and unhandled changes can substantially compromise the user's QoE.
   In this document, we investigate network-aware applications (NAA),
   which realize cloud-based interactive services with improved QoE, by
   efficient utilization of a solution named Mobile and Wireless
   Information Exposure (MoWIE).  In particular, this document
   demonstrates, through realistic evaluations, that mobile network
   information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can
   effectively expose the dynamicity of the underlying network and can
   be made available to applications through MoWIE; using such an
   information, the applications can then adapt key control knobs such
   as media codec schemes, encapsulation, and application layer
   processing to minimize QoE distortion.  Based on the evaluations, we
   discuss how the MoWIE features can define extensions of the ALTO
   protocol, to expose more lower-layer and finer grain network
   dynamics.

1.  Current Status of Network-Aware Applications

   With the deployment of 5G networks
   [draft-ietf-dmm-5g-uplane-analysis] , an increasing number of remote
   cloud-based applications are being deployed (e.g., cloud AR/VR/MR).
   Many conventional interactive, daily business applications are also
   becoming widely used as cloud applications, with the help of mobile
   networks and cloud, e.g., cloud video conference.  This shift was
   further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many
   people had to stay at home and work/study remotely

   To optimize QoE for end users using mobile networks (a.k.a., cellular
   networks), many cloud applications utilize information about the
   mobile network status, e.g., delay, bandwidth, and jitter, to
   dynamically balance the generated media traffic and the rendering/
   mixing in the cloud.  Currently, such an application assumes the
   network as a link and continuously uses client or server measurements
   to detect network characteristics, and then adaptively changes its
   network-related configuration parameters, possibly impacitng QoS
   handling and logical functions supporting the upper layer
   application.  However, when only application information is utilized,
   the QoE that an application achieves is limited for several reasons.
   First, information from the application side (i.e., the 3rd party
   application server) may have a relatively long delay.  When a user
   enters a location with a bad network connectivity, such as an
   elevator or an underground garage, the application will not receive
   such an information immediately.  As a result, the buffer of a video
   application may run out, resulting in a frozen screen and harming
   users' QoE.  The application also does not have information about
   other users in the cell.  Thus, it cannot know how many resources it
   can get and when this will change.  If other users enter the cell and
   compete for resources, the application layer may misjudge the
   resources available and request a high bitrate.  Then, the delay will
   increase and QoE will again drop.  Information from the network layer
   such as physical resource block (PRB) information and utilization
   rate can help applications decide how many resources a user can
   access in order to inform network quality predictions and further
   optimize video streaming.  The application, however, cannot get this
   kind of information yet.  Because 5G networks deployed by a mobile
   network operation are normally in a different domain than 3rd-party
   internet-based applications, the application server can not directly
   get the network internal status without network exposure.  For this
   reason, there have been continuous efforts in 3GPP to increase
   network exposure.

   3GPP mobile networks adhere to standard solutions to get dynamic
   network indicators for use by applications.  In 3GPP, many IP-based
   QoS mechanisms are used.  For example, ECN [RFC3168] has been
   supported by the 4G radio station (eNB) to provide CE(Congestion
   Encountered) information to the IMS application to perform Adaptive
   Bitrate (ABR) [TS26.114] . The application can downgrade the bit rate
   after receiving the CE indication, but does not know the exact bit
   rate to be selected.  DSCP [RFC2474] is used to identify the QoS
   class and paging strategy [TS23.501] , but typically the application
   cannot dynamically change the DSCP to improve bit rate based on
   network status.  Mapping DSCP with 4G QCI or 5G 5QI standards could
   be a good approach to better realize end-to-end QoS.  DASH [MPEGDASH]
   is an MPEG standard widely used by applications to predict the
   throughput of the network based on the current throughput and
   buffering state in order to dynamically select a suitable bitrate for
   the next segment of video streaming which avoids re-buffering.  SAND-
   DASH [TS26.247] defines the mechanism through which the network/
   server can provide available throughput to applications; in this
   case, the better bitrate can be selected by DASH application.

   There is also some early work on network status exposure to TCP
   servers which may also indirectly impact application layer
   optimization but it does not consider 5G networks [Sprecher_mobile] ,
   [flinck_mobile] In 5G cellular networks, network capability exposure
   has been specified to allow the 5G system (5GS) to expose user device
   location and network status to 3rd party application servers, modeled
   as AF (Application Function) [TS23.501] . In such a case, the AF can
   request the 5GS to establish a dedicated QoS Flow to transport an IP
   flow with the AF-provided QoS requirements.  Via certain
   measurements, network internal status, including congestion, can be
   exposed and optimization can be carried out for the cellular network
   [PBECC] .

   5G also can provide QNC (QoS Notification Control) to an AF if the
   GBR(Guaranteed Bitrate) of the established GBR QoS Flow cannot be
   fulfilled.  After receiving the QNC notification the AF can change
   the bitrate, but the AF has no information on which bitrate to
   select.  So, 5G enhances the QNC by providing a list of AQPs
   (alternative QoS profiles).  With AQP, a 5G network provides a subset
   of supported AQPs with the QNC, and then the AF selects a bit rate
   from 5G network supported AQPs.  In such a case, the GBR can be
   fulfilled again if the radio state of the UE is changed.  QoS
   prediction is realized by a network function inside 5GS which
   collects and analyzes the status and qualities of 5G network
   entities, and deliver the analytics results to an entity such as
   application server.

   However, both network capability exposure and QoS prediction
   solutions are only designed for 5G access and core networks, which
   cannot cover the whole end-to-end network.  Enabling applications to
   detect and understand the various lower layers within 5G networks,
   particularly the internal DN (data network), is an important area for
   both industrial and academic researchers.  This challenge is
   addressed by MoWIE.

   MoWIE is a solution that aims to realize real-time provisioning of
   cellular radio network information by networks to applications, thus
   helping service providers achieve better policy control and improve
   user experience.  The benefits of the MoWIE concept/solution have
   been experimentally evaluated in several use cases, detailed in
   Section XXXXX TO EDIT.

2.  MoWIE Architecture and Applications

2.1.  Architecture of MoWIE

   The fundamental idea of MoWIE is to provide on-demand and periodic
   network information from the network to applications, enhancing
   policy control and user experience.  The architecture comprises three
   core components: the Client Application, the Mobile Network, and the
   Application Server.  Raw data collected from the radio and core
   networks are processed and exposed to the Application Server.  This
   server can then request network information and use this information
   to optimize application functions like bit rate, latency, and jitter.
   Network information provided by MoWIE includes the following:

   Cell level Information:

   *  Number of Downlink PRBs (Physical Resource Blocks) occupied during
      sampling period

   *  Cell load

   *  Downklink (DL) MAC data rate per cell

   *  DL data rate

   *  Channel status (e.g.  RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) and
      CQI (Channel Quality Indicator))

   *  PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) buffer status

   UE level information (omitting privacy information):

   *  DL Signal to Inference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)

   *  Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)

   *  Number of packets occupied in PDCP buffer

   *  Number of DL PDCP Service Data Unit (SDU) packets

   *  Number of lost PDCP SDU packets

   *  Per-UE DL MAC data rate

   *  Per-UE DL data rate

   *  Per-UE channel status

   *  Per-UE PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) buffer status

   The network information listed here can also be found in 3GPP (PRB
   [TS38.211] , cell load [TS38.300] PDCP for 5G [TS38.323] RSRP, RSRQ,
   RSSI [TS38.331] , MCS, CQI [TS38.214] , The number of packets
   occupied in PDCP buffer, the number of DL PDCP SDU packets, the
   number of PDCP SDU packets lost, the per-UE PDCP buffer status
   [TS38.323] ), demonstrate the potential benefits of MoWIE for
   network-application integration over cellular network.  Figure 3-1
   and Figure 3-2 list the data types correponding to the cell-level
   information and UE-level information respectively.

2.2.  Application of MoWIE to Standard NAAs

   Cloud gaming, low-delay live shows, and cloud VR are commons NAAs
   whose QoE can be largely enhanced using MoWIE.  These applications
   require low latency and reliable transmission, interactive features,
   and high data rates.  For instance, cloud gaming demands fast,
   reliable connections between user devices and cloud servers for
   motion tracking and visual content delivery, significantly
   contributing to network traffic.  Similarly, low-delay live shows
   require interactive capabilities with sub-100 ms delays for audience
   engagement, while cloud VR demands extensive bandwidth and latency as
   low as 20 ms due to its high data volumes and rendering requirements.

   Performance requirements across these applications may be
   characterized by a parameter range.  Here we connsider 1080p~4K as
   the resolution range, 60-120 FPS (Frames per second) as the frame
   rate and H.265 as an example compression algorithm.  Given these
   settings, cloud gaming requires a bandwhich of 20-60 Mbps and latency
   under 200 ms.  For low-delay live shows, 20-50 Mbps bandwidth and
   latency under 100 ms are needed, while cloud VR demands 100-500 Mbps
   bandwidth and latency under 50 ms.  These values are dependent on the
   parameter settings and are provided to illustrate the order of
   magnitude of these parameters for the aforementioned use cases.

   MoWIE's network information can be used to enhance these
   applications, particularly in mobile and wireless contexts where
   existing methods struggle due to indirect or delayed network status
   measurements.  By providing direct, real-time data, MoWIE enables
   more responsive and effective application adjustments, leading to
   substantial performance gains and enhanced QoE.

2.3.  Preliminary Evaluations and Benefits

   Preliminary tests demonstrate significant QoE improvements for NAAs
   using MoWIE.  By integrating real-time network information,
   applications can optimize performance, leading to enhanced QoE and
   resource savings.

2.3.1.  RAN-assisted TCP optimization

   In trials on real mobile netowrks, RAN information was used to inform
   TCP sending window adjustment by predicting bandwidth and buffer
   status per-UE at RTT granularity (100 ms) and piggybacking such
   information in TCP ACK.  This approach has shown throughput boosts of
   up to 100%.

2.3.2.  ROI Detection

   ROI (Region of Interest) detection has been widely studied in
   recently years as a mechanism to reduce video size and bandwidth
   consumption by dynamically re-allocating coding schemes for
   interested and non-interested regions.  Current methods utilize
   application information like application rate and application buffer
   size as the indicators to roughly adjust the algorithm in interactive
   video services.  However, this information is hard to reflect the
   real-time network status precisely, making it difficult to balance
   QoE and bandwidth savings in real-time scenarios, including the
   standard NAAs outlined above.  MoWIE's network information can
   provide direct, real-time data to improve the performance of ROI
   methods.

   Experiments evaluated the following four methods of ROI detection: 1)
   no ROI detection, 2) rough ROI detection at 10ms delay, 3) accurate
   ROI detection at 40-70ms delay, and 4) dynamic ROI detection in which
   bandwidth traces are used to compute transmission delay and inform
   ROI algorithm adjustments.  Network conditions varied from poor
   (Network 1) to good (Network 2) and fluctuating (Network 3).  Our
   findings show that method 4 provides the best balance between QoE and
   bandwidth savings, especially in adverse network scenarios.

2.3.3.  Adaptive Bitrate

   Many applications such as video live streaming and cloud gaming
   employ adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to optimize user QoE [MPC]
   [CS2P].  However, traditional ABR algorithms use fixed control rules
   based on simplified or inaccurate models of the deployment
   environment, leading to suboptimal performance across a broad set of
   network conditions and QoE objectives.  More recent ABR algorithms,
   such as Pensieve [Hongzi], use reinforcement learning to optimize
   QoE, but still suffer from limitations due to indirect or delayed
   network status measurements and an incomplete set of network
   information.  MoWIE's network information can be used to enhance ABR
   algorithms, particularly in challenging network conditions.

   This experiement applied AI-based rate adaptation utilizing MCS
   network information from gNBs [TS38.214] in cloud-gaming over
   Tencent's China Mobile LTE network.  MCS information was provided
   directly to the applciation.  Data was collected over several network
   conditions: 1) low bandwhich, 2) high user load, 3-5) random user
   distributions.  Lagging rate is defined as the ratio between the
   number of frames with transmission delay greater than 200ms and the
   total number of frames.

   We clearly observe a significant reduction in lagging rates across
   all scenarios.

   It is noted that the more real-time network resource status the
   application can learn, the better it can predict how much network
   resource it can use within a prediction time window.  However, there
   is tradeoff between network information collection frequency and its
   load and feasibility to the network devices.  In principle, the total
   network resource consumed for such network status reporting is also
   designed in light-weight manner, e.g., by properly controlling the
   interval of report and also the number of bits needed to convey the
   reported information elements.  In our experiments, the network
   status information can be obtained in an adaptive interval based on
   the change rate of network status, in order to provide good
   prediction with less load introduced in the network.  In fact, not
   all scenarios need a very frequent information collection.  If some
   information only changes in a very small range and won't influence
   the final decision, it is unnecessary to report such information all
   the time.  However, if its value varies over the preset threshold, it
   will inform the application immediately.

   The distribution and impact of the exposed data to the performance
   gain for different algorithm needs to be further studied.  This draft
   is to give a guidance to figure out what kind of data needs to be
   exposed during initial deployment of these mechanisms.

4.  Standardization Considerations of MoWIE as an Extension to ALTO

   In 3GPP, network information exposure based on control plane
   mechanism is introduced in 4G and 5G systems.  In 3GPP Release 17,
   there is a work item named 5G_AIS (Advanced Interactive Services)
   which focuses on QoS enhancements for interactive services including
   cloud gaming, XR, remote driving and real-time digital twin.  There
   is also continuous work in Release 18 XRM (XR and media services),
   which focuses on strengthening the interaction and collaboration
   between applications and networks by improving the ability of the
   network information exposure especially for XR and multimedia
   services.  MoWIE is closedly related to this study as it can be a
   tool to support exposure of 5G network status information.  MoWIE can
   also support QoS prediction technologies which is being applied to
   5G-enabled automated driving which is being developed in 5GAA
   [PQoS_white_paper] , this solution can use network information
   exposure to predict the future network changes to the application
   layer in order to be prepared for such changes and make adaptations
   in application layer to improve the QoE of users.  There have been
   close collaboration between 5GAA and 3GPP to provide E2E solutions on
   this area.

   Among these above mentioned work items, one important way to support
   QoS (MoWIE and PQoS) enhancements is to expose the network status
   information to the application layer and the application layer can
   take measures to adapt according to the network status information.
   The network information can include the radio network statistics as
   has been elaborated in Section 4.1 and also the parameters specified
   in [ALTO_METRICS] . In Section 4.1, the parameters which MoWIE
   proposes to expose can provide real-time status and rich information
   about the wireless link which can be utilized by AI-ML (Machine
   Learning) algorithms to predict the available network resources in
   the subsequent transmission opportunities, which can help the
   application layer to adjust its traffic pattern or codec profile to
   optimize the user’s experience.  By mapping these parameters with the
   ALTO metrics which has been proposed or defining potential new ALTO
   metrics, it is possible to extent current ALTO protocols to provide
   better support for real-time immersive services.  In ETSI MEC, RNIS
   [ETSI_MEC] has proposed to expose physical layer, Layer 2 and higher
   layer parameters including 4G and 5G.  There are some common
   parameters like RSRP, RSRQ and RSSI which MoWIE also proposes;
   however, RNIS is based on the MEC architecture, and MoWIE is not
   restricted to MEC case.

   It should be noticed that the previous mechanisms may also work on
   IEEE 802.11 standards (e.g., EHT), helping SP to have a better
   understanding for the network environment between AP and STAs.  Based
   on the fact that 802.11 devices are working on unlicensed spectrums,
   and easily influenced by adjacent unlicensed devices, duty cycles and
   related CQI information (e.g., MCS, and bandwidth) are considered
   very important network information here.  Standardization
   Considerations of MoWIE as an Extension to ALTO MoWIE can be a
   realistic, important extension to ALTO to serve the aforementioned
   use cases, in the setting of the newer generation (5G) of cellular
   network, which is a completely open IP based network where routers/
   UPF with IP connectivity will be deployed much closer to the users.
   One may consider not only the aforementioned cloud-based multimedia
   applications, but also other latency sensitive applications such as
   connected vehicles and automotive driving.

   Extending ALTO with MoWIE, therefore, may allow ALTO to expose lower
   layer network information to ensure higher application QoE for a wide
   spectrum of applications.

   One possible approach to standardizing the distribution of the
   network information used in the evaluations is to send such
   information as piggyback information in the data path.  One issue
   with data path method is that MoWIE intends to convey more complex
   and rich information than current methods.  To piggyback such complex
   and rich information in the data path will consume significant data
   path resource.  But the data path-based method can provide frequently
   changed network information and it is technically simpler to
   synchronize the network information and user data at the same time
   scale.  Normally, there is less user data in the uplink direction and
   the free "space" within the MTU can be used to piggyback the network
   information to the application, without the additional overhead of
   creating a second communication channel between the application and
   network.  However, the data path design may bring out more limited
   privacy management, which is very important in MoWIE.  The
   application cannot trust the network information if there is no
   message authentication mechanism for the piggyback network
   information.  How the network inserts the network information in the
   data packet is also challengeable since a lot of transport layer
   protocol are encrypted and integration protected.  Another method is
   to create an associated path aligned with data path.  Like the ICMP
   for IP and RTCP for RTP, this second path can be used to provide
   additional information associated with the data path.  But creating
   such second path is a big change to current widely used transport
   protocols and a lot of applications also need to change, this second
   path is also challengeable.

   In this draft, we mainly discuss ALTO extension-based design in
   tackling with this problem.  Specifically, the MoWIE extension will
   reuse existing ALTO mechanisms including information resource
   directory, extensible performance metrics and calendaring, and
   unified properties.  Below is an overview of key considerations;
   security considerations are in the following section.

   *  Network information selection and binding consideration: Instead
      of hardcoding only specific network information, a modular design
      of MoWIE is an ability for an ALTO client to select only the
      relevant information (e.g., cell DLOccupyPRBNum metric and UE MCS)
      and then request correspondingly.  Existing ALTO information
      resource directory is a starting point, but the design needs to be
      generic," to provide abstraction for ease of use and
      extensibility.  The security mechanisms of the existing ALTO
      protocol should also be extended to enforce proper authorization.

   *  Compact network information encoding considerations: One benefit
      of ALTO is its high-level JSON based encoding.  When the update
      frequency increases, the existing base protocol and existing
      extensions (in particular the SSE extension), however, may have
      high bandwidth and processing overhead.  Hence, encoding and
      processing overhead of MoWIE should be considered.

   *  Stability and reliability considerations: A key benefit of the
      MoWIE extension is the ability to allow more flexible, better
      coordinated control.  Any control mechanism, however, should
      integrate fundamental overhead, stability, and reliability
      mechanisms.

   *  Cost metrics considerations.  In [ALTO_METRICS] , some cost
      metrics are being standardized including throughput/bit rate,
      latency, priority, error rate, jitter.  These parameters can be
      linked with cost metrics in 5G network entities like network
      exposure function (NEF) [TS23.501] or application function (AF)
      [TS23.501] .  NEF or AF, which act as ALTO Clients, utilizing the
      network information exposure capability provided by 3GPP
      standards, can request to expose some of the proposed parameters
      with consideration of the ALTO performance metrics.

   With the better utilization of the 5G network, IETF ALTO can well
   benefit from MoWIE architecture and QoE for the use cases of NAA
   applications can be achieved with the help of the convergence of 5G
   network architecture and IETF ALTO.  For example, it was shown in
   Figure 5-1 that the ALTO client can act as AF or act as part of the
   functional module of AF to converge with the 5G system through the
   implementation in the AF.  It can receive the cellular-based network
   information through interaction with NEF, identify the ALTO server
   using ALTO service discovery, and request available ALTO information
   prepared by the ALTO server using ALTO Protocol [RFC7285] . The ALTO
   server can be implemented in other places through ALTO architecture
   and can interact with the third parties (e.g.  Content providers) via
   external interfaces.  Furthermore, the ALTO server can aggregate
   information from multiple functional entities to provide an abstract
   and unified view that can be more useful to applications.  Examples
   of other systems include (but are not limited to) static network
   configuration databases, dynamic network information, routing
   protocols, provisioning policies, and interfaces to outside parties
   [RFC7285] .  Please note that these components shown in Figure 5-1
   are out of IETF ALTO scope and are just for completeness to put here.
   As a result, the ALTO Client can perform ALTO Service Discovery and
   interact with the ALTO server via ALTO Protocol to get the ALTO
   information and ALTO metrics regarding the proposed parameters with
   the help of MoWIE that can be updated dynamically based on network
   conditions from cellular aspects in Section 4.1.  It is noted that in
   addition to AF-based convergence architecture which relies on
   control-plane interfaces e.g.  N5/N33, MoWIE can also utilized user
   plane exposure via N6 or UPF which makes network exposure mechanisms
   more comprehensive and flexisble.

       Figure 5-1: Convergence of 5G network architecture and IETF ALTO

   By extending the exposure scope of network information beyond the
   cellular access, ALTO can help improve the QoE of several
   applications running on endpoints located in cellular networks.
   [ALTO_USE_CASES] is work in progress that investigates use cases
   where the performances of these applications can be further improved
   with abstracted network information and suitable transportation means
   provided by ALTO.  Additionally, upon reviewing the existing ALTO
   capabilities, it lists the ALTO features that need to be extended or
   defined to support the presented use cases.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   The collection, distribution of MoWIE information should consider the
   security requirements on information privacy and information
   integration protection and authentication in both sides.  Since the
   network status is not directly related to any special user, there is
   currently no any privacy issue.  But the information transmitted to
   the application can pass through a lot of middle box and can be
   changed by the man in the middle.  To protect the network
   information, an end to end encryption and integration is needed.
   Also, the network needs to authenticate the information exposure
   provided to right applications.  These security requirements can be
   implemented by the TLS and other security mechanisms.
