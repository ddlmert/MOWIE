                  MoWIE for Network Aware Application

Abstract

   TODO: ADD ABSTRACT ONCE DRAFT IS COMPLETE - BASE OFF OF THE
   FOLLOWING: With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based
   interactive services such as cloud gaming have gained substantial
   attention.  To ensure users' quality of experience (QoE), a cloud
   interactive service may require not only high bandwidth (e.g., high-
   resolution media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency
   and low lagging).  However, the quality perceived by a user with
   mobile and wireless device may vary, as a function of many factors,
   and unhandled changes can substantially compromise the user's QoE.
   In this document, we investigate network-aware applications (NAA),
   which realize cloud-based interactive services with improved QoE, by
   efficient utilization of a solution named Mobile and Wireless
   Information Exposure (MoWIE).  In particular, this document
   demonstrates, through realistic evaluations, that mobile network
   information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can
   effectively expose the dynamicity of the underlying network and can
   be made available to applications through MoWIE; using such an
   information, the applications can then adapt key control knobs such
   as media codec schemes, encapsulation, and application layer
   processing to minimize QoE distortion.  Based on the evaluations, we
   discuss how the MoWIE features can define extensions of the ALTO
   protocol, to expose more lower-layer and finer grain network
   dynamics.

1.  Current Status of Network-Aware Applications

   With the deployment of 5G networks
   [draft-ietf-dmm-5g-uplane-analysis] , an increasing number of remote
   cloud-based applications are being deployed (e.g., cloud AR/VR/MR).
   Many conventional interactive, daily business applications are also
   becoming widely used as cloud applications, with the help of mobile
   networks and cloud, e.g., cloud video conference.  This shift was
   further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many
   people had to stay at home and work/study remotely

   To optimize QoE for end users using mobile networks (a.k.a., cellular
   networks), many cloud applications utilize information about the
   mobile network status, e.g., delay, bandwidth, and jitter, to
   dynamically balance the generated media traffic and the rendering/
   mixing in the cloud.  Currently, such an application assumes the
   network as a link and continuously uses client or server measurements
   to detect network characteristics, and then adaptively changes its
   network-related configuration parameters, possibly impacting QoS
   handling and logical functions supporting the upper layer
   application.  However, when only application information is utilized,
   the QoE that an application achieves is limited for several reasons.
   First, information from the application side (i.e., the 3rd party
   application server) may have a relatively long delay.  When a user
   enters a location with a bad network connectivity, such as an
   elevator or an underground garage, the application will not receive
   such an information immediately.  As a result, the buffer of a video
   application may run out, resulting in a frozen screen and harming
   users' QoE.  The application also does not have information about
   other users in the cell.  Thus, it cannot know how many resources it
   can get and when this will change.  If other users enter the cell and
   compete for resources, the application layer may misjudge the
   resources available and request a high bitrate.  Then, the delay will
   increase and QoE will again drop.  Information from the network layer
   such as physical resource block (PRB) information and utilization
   rate can help applications decide how many resources a user can
   access in order to inform network quality predictions and further
   optimize video streaming.  The application, however, cannot get this
   kind of information yet.  Because 5G networks deployed by a mobile
   network operation are normally in a different domain than 3rd-party
   internet-based applications, the application server can not directly
   get the network internal status without network exposure.  For this
   reason, there have been continuous efforts in 3GPP to increase
   network exposure.

   3GPP mobile networks adhere to standard solutions to get dynamic
   network indicators for use by applications.  In 3GPP, many IP-based
   QoS mechanisms are used.  For example, ECN [RFC3168] has been
   supported by the 4G radio station (eNB) to provide CE(Congestion
   Encountered) information to the IMS application to perform Adaptive
   Bitrate (ABR) [TS26.114] . The application can downgrade the bit rate
   after receiving the CE indication, but does not know the exact bit
   rate to be selected.  DSCP [RFC2474] is used to identify the QoS
   class and paging strategy [TS23.501] , but typically the application
   cannot dynamically change the DSCP to improve bit rate based on
   network status.  Mapping DSCP with 4G QCI or 5G 5QI standards could
   be a good approach to better realize end-to-end QoS.  DASH [MPEGDASH]
   is an MPEG standard widely used by applications to predict the
   throughput of the network based on the current throughput and
   buffering state in order to dynamically select a suitable bitrate for
   the next segment of video streaming which avoids re-buffering.  SAND-
   DASH [TS26.247] defines the mechanism through which the network/
   server can provide available throughput to applications; in this
   case, the better bitrate can be selected by DASH application.

   There is also some early work on network status exposure to TCP
   servers which may also indirectly impact application layer
   optimization but it does not consider 5G networks [Sprecher_mobile] ,
   [flinck_mobile] In 5G cellular networks, network capability exposure
   has been specified to allow the 5G system (5GS) to expose user device
   location and network status to 3rd party application servers, modeled
   as AF (Application Function) [TS23.501] . In such a case, the AF can
   request the 5GS to establish a dedicated QoS Flow to transport an IP
   flow with the AF-provided QoS requirements.  Via certain
   measurements, network internal status, including congestion, can be
   exposed and optimization can be carried out for the cellular network
   [PBECC] .

   5G also can provide QNC (QoS Notification Control) to an AF if the
   GBR(Guaranteed Bitrate) of the established GBR QoS Flow cannot be
   fulfilled.  After receiving the QNC notification the AF can change
   the bitrate, but the AF has no information on which bitrate to
   select.  So, 5G enhances the QNC by providing a list of AQPs
   (alternative QoS profiles).  With AQP, a 5G network provides a subset
   of supported AQPs with the QNC, and then the AF selects a bit rate
   from 5G network supported AQPs.  In such a case, the GBR can be
   fulfilled again if the radio state of the UE is changed.  QoS
   prediction is realized by a network function inside 5GS which
   collects and analyzes the status and qualities of 5G network
   entities, and deliver the analytics results to an entity such as
   application server.

   However, both network capability exposure and QoS prediction
   solutions are only designed for 5G access and core networks, which
   cannot cover the whole end-to-end network.  Enabling applications to
   detect and understand the various lower layers within 5G networks,
   particularly the internal DN (data network), is an important area for
   both industrial and academic researchers.  This challenge is
   addressed by MoWIE.

   MoWIE is a solution that aims to realize real-time provisioning of
   cellular radio network information by networks to applications, thus
   helping service providers achieve better policy control and improve
   user experience.  The benefits of the MoWIE concept/solution have
   been experimentally evaluated in several use cases, detailed in
   Section XXXXX TO EDIT.

2.  MoWIE Architecture and Applications

2.1.  Architecture of MoWIE

   The fundamental idea of MoWIE is to provide on-demand and periodic
   network information from the network to applications, enhancing
   policy control and user experience.  The architecture comprises three
   core components: the Client Application, the Mobile Network, and the
   Application Server.  Raw data collected from the Mobile Network is
   processed and exposed to the Application Server.  This server can
   then request network information and use this information to optimize
   application functions in the Client Application like bit rate,
   latency, and jitter.  Network information provided by MoWIE includes
   the following:

   Cell level Information:

   *  Number of Downlink PRBs (Physical Resource Blocks) occupied during
      sampling period

   *  Cell load

   *  Downlink (DL) MAC data rate per cell

   *  DL data rate

   *  Channel status (e.g.  RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) and
      CQI (Channel Quality Indicator))

   *  PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) buffer status

   UE level information (omitting privacy information):

   *  DL Signal to Inference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)

   *  Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)

   *  Number of packets occupied in PDCP buffer

   *  Number of DL PDCP Service Data Unit (SDU) packets

   *  Number of lost PDCP SDU packets

   *  Per-UE DL MAC data rate

   *  Per-UE DL data rate

   *  Per-UE channel status

   *  Per-UE PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) buffer status

   The network information listed here can also be found in 3GPP (PRB
   [TS38.211] , cell load [TS38.300] PDCP for 5G [TS38.323] RSRP, RSRQ,
   RSSI [TS38.331] , MCS, CQI [TS38.214] , The number of packets
   occupied in PDCP buffer, the number of DL PDCP SDU packets, the
   number of PDCP SDU packets lost, the per-UE PDCP buffer status
   [TS38.323] ), demonstrate the potential benefits of MoWIE for
   network-application integration over cellular network.  Figure 3-1
   and Figure 3-2 list the data types corresponding to the cell-level
   information and UE-level information respectively.

2.2.  Standard NAA Use Cases for MoWIE

   Cloud gaming, low-delay live shows, and cloud VR are commons NAAs
   whose QoE can be largely enhanced using MoWIE.  These applications
   require low latency and reliable transmission, interactive features,
   and high data rates.  For instance, cloud gaming demands fast,
   reliable connections between user devices and cloud servers for
   motion tracking and visual content delivery, significantly
   contributing to network traffic.  Similarly, low-delay live shows
   require interactive capabilities with sub-100 ms delays for audience
   engagement, while cloud VR demands extensive bandwidth and latency as
   low as 20 ms due to its high data volumes and rendering requirements.

   Performance requirements across these applications may be
   characterized by a parameter range.  Here we consider 1080p~4K as the
   resolution range, 60-120 FPS (Frames per second) as the frame rate
   and H.265 as an example compression algorithm.  Given these settings,
   cloud gaming requires a bandwidth of 20-60 Mbps and latency under 200
   ms.  For low-delay live shows, 20-50 Mbps bandwidth and latency under
   100 ms are needed, while cloud VR demands 100-500 Mbps bandwidth and
   latency under 50 ms.  These values are dependent on the parameter
   settings and are provided to illustrate the order of magnitude of
   these parameters for the aforementioned use cases.

   MoWIE's network information can be used to enhance these
   applications, particularly in mobile and wireless contexts where
   existing methods struggle due to indirect or delayed network status
   measurements.  By providing direct, real-time data, MoWIE enables
   more responsive and effective application adjustments, leading to
   substantial performance gains and enhanced QoE.

2.3.  Preliminary Evaluations and Benefits

   Preliminary tests demonstrate significant QoE improvements for NAAs
   using MoWIE.  By integrating real-time network information,
   applications can optimize performance, leading to enhanced QoE and
   resource savings.

2.3.1.  RAN-assisted TCP optimization

   In trials on real mobile networks, RAN information was used to inform
   TCP sending window adjustment by predicting bandwidth and buffer
   status per-UE at RTT granularity (100 ms) and piggybacking such
   information in TCP ACK.  This approach has shown throughput boosts of
   up to 100%.

2.3.2.  ROI Detection

   ROI (Region of Interest) detection has been widely studied in
   recently years as a mechanism to reduce video size and bandwidth
   consumption by dynamically re-allocating coding schemes for
   interested and non-interested regions.  Current methods utilize
   application information like application rate and application buffer
   size as the indicators to roughly adjust the algorithm in interactive
   video services.  However, this information is hard to reflect the
   real-time network status precisely, making it difficult to balance
   QoE and bandwidth savings in real-time scenarios, including the
   standard NAAs outlined above.  MoWIE's network information can
   provide direct, real-time data to improve the performance of ROI
   methods.

   Experiments evaluated the following four methods of ROI detection: 1)
   no ROI detection, 2) rough ROI detection at 10ms delay, 3) accurate
   ROI detection at 40-70ms delay, and 4) dynamic ROI detection in which
   bandwidth traces are used to compute transmission delay and inform
   ROI algorithm adjustments.  Network conditions varied from poor
   (Network 1) to good (Network 2) and fluctuating (Network 3).  Our
   findings show that method 4 provides the best balance between QoE and
   bandwidth savings, especially in adverse network scenarios.

2.3.3.  Adaptive Bitrate

   Many applications such as video live streaming and cloud gaming
   employ adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to optimize user QoE [MPC]
   [CS2P].  However, traditional ABR algorithms use fixed control rules
   based on simplified or inaccurate models of the deployment
   environment, leading to suboptimal performance across a broad set of
   network conditions and QoE objectives.  More recent ABR algorithms,
   such as Pensieve [Hongzi], use reinforcement learning to optimize
   QoE, but still suffer from limitations due to indirect or delayed
   network status measurements and an incomplete set of network
   information.  MoWIE's network information can be used to enhance ABR
   algorithms, particularly in challenging network conditions.

   This experiment applied AI-based rate adaptation utilizing MCS
   network information from gNBs [TS38.214] in cloud-gaming over
   Tencent's China Mobile LTE network.  MCS information was provided
   directly to the application.  Data was collected over several network
   conditions: 1) low bandwidth, 2) high user load, 3-5) random user
   distributions.  Lagging rate is defined as the ratio between the
   number of frames with transmission delay greater than 200ms and the
   total number of frames.

3.  On-path Signaling using QUIC

   This section explores a possible implementation of the MoWIE
   framework using on-path signaling, or inband communication, within
   the QUIC protocol.  We aim to achieve the properties set forth in the
   charter of the Secure Communication of Network Properties (SCONEPRO)
   Working Group [SCONEPRO] while being in accordance with signaling
   design principles recommended in [RFC9419].

3.1.  Technical Framework

   Within the Mobile Network, 5G gNBs will regularly collect and process
   the network information included in the MoWIE framework.  The
   Application Server must then discover the on-path gNB.  This may be
   done by the gNB advertising itself to the Application Server by
   appending additional QUIC packets to existing connection; possible
   methods for this are discussed in [SADCDN].  The Application Server
   can then establish a QUIC connection with the gNB and request network
   information, both individually and at regular specified intervals.
   The gNB will then respond with the requested information, which the
   Application Server can use to optimize the application's behavior.

   Note that the Application Server initiates the QUIC connection and
   thus the communication channel is under the application's control and
   aligns with their networking requirements.  Care must be taken during
   initiation to ensure that the additional QUIC packets can not affect
   core application functionality.  This process should be transparent
   and respect users privacy, adhering to the principles of minimal
   information exposure and user consent outlined in [RFC9419].  The
   process should also allow for negotiation of signaling parameters to
   ensure trust between the Application Server and gNB.  The Application
   Server may leverage QUIC's secure and authenticated transport layer
   to ensure the integrity and security of the communication.

   Since the Application Server must pull network information from the
   gNB, the process is optional.  The Application Server can choose to
   request only the network information desired, only when it is
   desired. ach additional QUIC connection must be lightweight to assist
   in scalability.  Scalability will ultimately depend on the
   performance capabilities of gNBs.  These additional QUIC connections
   may strain gNB when under heavy user load.

3.2.  Security Considerations

   Of key importance in this implementation is the security of the
   exchanged data.  Once authentication between the Application Server
   and gNB has taken place, any exchanged data must be protected from
   becoming a vector for possible malicious action.  Standard
   cryptographic techniques should be employed to ensure the
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the signaling data.
   Misuse of this signaling mechanism should be minimized through common
   security practices such as rate limiting.

   The initial exposure of the gNB to the Application Server must take
   place prior to authentication between these two entities.  This must
   be carefully managed to ensure that the gNB is not exposed to any
   malicious actors.

3.3.  Benefits and Drawbacks of On-path Signaling

   On-path signaling is a powerful tool for enabling real-time network
   information exchange to enable dynamic NAAs.  The primary benefit of
   an implementation with on-path signaling is that it greatly
   simplifies the challenge of associating a particular Application
   Server/Client Application pair with the relevant gNB and as a result,
   the relevant set of network information.

   However, on-path signaling also presents several challenges.  The
   mechanism of initial connection outlined above relies on the gNB
   piggybacking off the existing QUIC connection to advertise itself to
   the Application Server.  To append additional packets on an UDP
   option or IP header would require support from both the Application
   Server and Client Application which may be difficult to ensure.  The
   alternative of encapsulating the original payload within a new layer
   requires the gNB to be able to parse the original, encrypted payload,
   and may affect, for example, performance of the original core
   functionality.  In both cases we are fighting the encryption and
   integration protection of the original QUIC connection.

   Another challenge is the increased overhead associated with
   maintaining additional QUIC channels.  As indicated earlier, in high-
   traffic scenarios this load may strain gNBs and due to the nature of
   on-path signaling, the gNB is the only entity that can provide the
   network information.  This may create bottlenecks and limit the
   scalability of the solution.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The collection, distribution of MoWIE information should consider the
   security requirements on information privacy and information
   integration protection and authentication in both sides.  Since the
   network status is not directly related to any special user, there is
   currently no any privacy issue.  But the information transmitted to
   the application can pass through a lot of middle box and can be
   changed by the man in the middle.  To protect the network
   information, an end to end encryption and integration is needed.
   Also, the network needs to authenticate the information exposure
   provided to right applications.  These security requirements can be
   implemented by the TLS and other security mechanisms.
