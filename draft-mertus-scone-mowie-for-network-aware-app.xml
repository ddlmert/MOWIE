      TODO: ADD ABSTRACT ONCE DRAFT IS COMPLETE - BASE OFF OF THE FOLLOWING:

   With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based
   interactive services such as cloud gaming have gained substantial
   attention. To ensure users' quality of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive
   service may require not only high bandwidth (e.g., high-resolution
   media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency and low
   lagging).  However, the quality perceived by a user with mobile
   and wireless device may vary, as a function of many factors, and
   unhandled changes can substantially compromise the user's QoE.  In this
   document, we investigate network-aware applications (NAA), which
   realize cloud-based interactive services with improved QoE, by
   efficient utilization of a solution named Mobile and Wireless Information Exposure
   (MoWIE). In particular, this document demonstrates, through
   realistic evaluations, that mobile network information such as MCS
   (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can effectively expose the dynamicity
   of the underlying network and can be made available to applications
   through MoWIE; using such an information, the applications can then
   adapt key control knobs such as media codec schemes, encapsulation, and
   application layer processing to minimize QoE distortion. Based on the
   evaluations, we discuss how the MoWIE features can define extensions of the ALTO protocol,
   to expose more lower-layer and finer grain network dynamics.</t>

      <section title="Current Status of Network-Aware Applications" anchor="sect-1">
         <t>
   With the deployment of 5G networks <xref target="draft-ietf-dmm-5g-uplane-analysis"/>
, an increasing number of
   remote cloud-based
   applications are being deployed (e.g., cloud AR/VR/MR).
   Many conventional interactive, daily business applications are also becoming widely used
   as cloud applications, with the help of mobile networks and cloud, e.g., cloud video
   conference. This shift was further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many people had to stay at home and work/study remotely</t>


         <t>
   To optimize QoE for end users using mobile networks (a.k.a., cellular networks),
   many cloud applications utilize information about the mobile network status, e.g.,
   delay, bandwidth, and jitter, to dynamically balance the generated media
   traffic and the rendering/mixing in the cloud. Currently, such an
   application assumes the network as a link and continuously uses
   client or server measurements to detect network characteristics,
   and then adaptively changes its network-related configuration parameters, possibly impacitng QoS handling
   and logical functions supporting the upper layer application.  However, when only application information is
   utilized, the QoE that an application achieves is limited for several reasons.
   First, information from the application side (i.e., the 3rd party application server)
   may have a relatively long delay. When a user
   enters a location with a bad network connectivity, such as an elevator or an underground
   garage, the application will not receive such an information
   immediately.  As a result, the buffer of a video application may run out, resulting in a frozen screen and harming users' QoE. The application also does not have information
   about other users in the cell.  Thus, it cannot know how many
   resources it can get and when this will change.  If other users enter
   the cell and compete for resources, the application layer may misjudge
   the resources available and request a high bitrate.  Then, the delay will
   increase and QoE will again drop. Information from the network layer such as
   physical resource block (PRB) information and utilization rate can
   help applications decide how many resources a user can access in order to inform network quality predictions and  further optimize video streaming. The application, however, cannot get
   this kind of information yet. Because 5G networks deployed by a mobile
   network operation are normally in a different domain than 3rd-party internet-based
   applications, the application server can not directly get the
   network internal status without network exposure. For this reason, there have been continuous
   efforts in 3GPP to increase network exposure.</t>

         <t>
   3GPP mobile networks adhere to standard solutions to get
   dynamic network indicators for use by applications.  In 3GPP, many IP-based QoS mechanisms are used. For example,
   ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/>
 has been
   supported by the 4G radio station (eNB) to provide CE(Congestion
   Encountered) information to the IMS application to perform
   Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) <xref target="TS26.114"/>
. The application can downgrade the
   bit rate after receiving the CE indication, but does not know the exact
   bit rate to be selected. DSCP <xref target="RFC2474"/>
 is used to identify the
   QoS class and paging strategy <xref target="TS23.501"/>
, but typically the application
   cannot dynamically change the DSCP to improve bit rate based on
   network status. Mapping DSCP with 4G QCI or 5G 5QI standards could be a good approach to better realize end-to-end QoS.


   DASH <xref target="MPEGDASH"/>
 is an MPEG standard widely used by
   applications to predict the throughput of the network based on the
   current throughput and buffering state in order to dynamically select a suitable bitrate for the
   next segment of video streaming which
   avoids re-buffering. SAND-DASH <xref target="TS26.247"/>
 defines the mechanism
   through which the network/server can provide available throughput to
   applications; in this case, the better bitrate can be selected by DASH
   application.</t>

<t>
   There is also some early work on network status exposure to TCP servers which may
   also indirectly impact application layer optimization but it does not consider 5G networks <xref target="Sprecher_mobile"/>
,
<xref target="flinck_mobile"/>
   In 5G cellular networks, network capability exposure has been
   specified to allow the 5G system (5GS) to expose user device
   location and network status to 3rd party application servers,
   modeled as AF (Application Function) <xref target="TS23.501"/>
. In such a case, the AF
   can request the 5GS to establish a dedicated QoS Flow to transport an
   IP flow with the AF-provided QoS requirements. Via certain measurements,
   network internal status, including congestion, can be exposed and optimization
   can be carried out for the cellular network <xref target="PBECC"/>
.</t>

<t>
   5G also can
   provide QNC (QoS Notification Control) to an AF if the
   GBR(Guaranteed Bitrate) of the established GBR QoS Flow cannot be
   fulfilled. After receiving the QNC
   notification the AF can change the bitrate, but the AF has no information on which bitrate to
   select. So, 5G enhances the QNC by providing a list of
   AQPs (alternative QoS profiles). With AQP, a 5G network provides
   a subset of supported AQPs with the QNC, and then the AF selects a bit
   rate from 5G network supported AQPs. In such a case, the GBR can
   be fulfilled again if the radio state of the UE is changed.  QoS
   prediction is realized by a network function inside 5GS which collects and
   analyzes the status and qualities of 5G network entities, and
   deliver the analytics results to an entity such as application
   server. </t>

<t>
   However, both network capability exposure and QoS
   prediction solutions are only designed for 5G access and core networks,
   which cannot cover the whole end-to-end network. Enabling applications to detect and understand the various lower layers within 5G networks, particularly the internal DN (data network), is an important area for both industrial and academic researchers. This challenge is addressed by MoWIE.
   </t>

<t>
   MoWIE is a solution that aims
   to realize real-time provisioning of cellular radio network information
   by networks to applications, thus helping service providers achieve better policy control and
   improve user experience. The benefits of the MoWIE concept/solution have been
   experimentally evaluated in several use cases, detailed in Section XXXXX TO EDIT.

   <section title="Architecture of MoWIE" anchor="sect-2-1">
     <t>
      The fundamental idea of MoWIE is to provide on-demand and periodic network information from the network to applications, enhancing policy control and user experience. The architecture comprises three core components: the Client Application, the Mobile Network, and the Application Server. Raw data collected from the radio and core networks are processed and exposed to the Application Server. This server can then request network information and use this information to optimize application functions like bit rate, latency, and jitter. Network information provided by MoWIE includes the following:

   <section title="Application of MoWIE to Standard NAAs" anchor="sect-2-2">
     <t>
       Cloud gaming, low-delay live shows, and cloud VR are commons NAAs whose QoE can be largely enhanced using MoWIE. These applications require low latency and reliable transmission, interactive features, and high data rates. For instance, cloud gaming demands fast, reliable connections between user devices and cloud servers for motion tracking and visual content delivery, significantly contributing to network traffic. Similarly, low-delay live shows require interactive capabilities with sub-100 ms delays for audience engagement, while cloud VR demands extensive bandwidth and latency as low as 20 ms due to its high data volumes and rendering requirements.
     </t>
     <t>
       Performance requirements across these applications may be characterized by a parameter range. Here we connsider 1080p~4K as the resolution range, 60-120 FPS (Frames per second) as the frame rate and H.265 as an example compression algorithm. Given these settings, cloud gaming requires a bandwhich of 20-60 Mbps and latency under 200 ms. For low-delay live shows, 20-50 Mbps bandwidth and latency under 100 ms are needed, while cloud VR demands 100-500 Mbps bandwidth and latency under 50 ms. These values are dependent on the parameter settings and are provided to illustrate the order of magnitude of these parameters for the aforementioned use cases.
     </t>
     <t>
         MoWIE's network information can be used to enhance these applications, particularly in mobile and wireless contexts where existing methods struggle due to indirect or delayed network status measurements. By providing direct, real-time data, MoWIE enables more responsive and effective application adjustments, leading to substantial performance gains and enhanced QoE.
     </t>


   </section>

   <section title="Preliminary Evaluations and Benefits" anchor="sect-2-3">
      <t>
         Preliminary tests demonstrate significant QoE improvements for NAAs using MoWIE. By integrating real-time network information, applications can optimize performance, leading to enhanced QoE and resource savings.
      </t>
     <section title="RAN-assisted TCP optimization" anchor="sect-2-3-1">
       <t>
         In trials on real mobile netowrks, RAN information was used to inform TCP sending window adjustment by predicting bandwidth and buffer status per-UE at RTT granularity (100 ms) and piggybacking such information in TCP ACK. This approach has shown throughput boosts of up to 100%.
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="ROI Detection" anchor="sect-2-3-2">

         <t>
            ROI (Region of Interest) detection has been widely studied in recently years as a mechanism to reduce video size and bandwidth consumption by dynamically re-allocating coding schemes for interested and non-interested regions. Current methods utilize application information like application rate and application buffer size as the indicators to roughly adjust the algorithm in interactive video services. However, this information is hard to reflect the real-time network status precisely, making it difficult to balance QoE and bandwidth savings in real-time scenarios, including the standard NAAs outlined above. MoWIE's network information can provide direct, real-time data to improve the performance of ROI methods.
         </t>

         <t>
            Experiments evaluated the following four methods of ROI detection: 1&#41; no ROI detection, 2&#41; rough ROI detection at 10ms delay, 3&#41; accurate ROI detection at 40-70ms delay, and 4&#41; dynamic ROI detection in which bandwidth traces are used to compute transmission delay and inform ROI algorithm adjustments. Network conditions varied from poor (Network 1) to good (Network 2) and fluctuating (Network 3). Our findings show that method 4 provides the best balance between QoE and bandwidth savings, especially in adverse network scenarios.

            Many applications such as video live streaming and cloud gaming employ adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to optimize user QoE <xref target="MPC"/>
            <xref target="CS2P"/>. However, traditional ABR algorithms use fixed control rules based on simplified or inaccurate models of the deployment environment, leading to suboptimal performance across a broad set of network conditions and QoE objectives. More recent ABR algorithms, such as Pensieve <xref target="Hongzi"/>, use reinforcement learning to optimize QoE, but still suffer from limitations due to indirect or delayed network status measurements and an incomplete set of network information. MoWIE's network information can be used to enhance ABR algorithms, particularly in challenging network conditions.

            This experiement applied AI-based rate adaptation utilizing MCS network information from gNBs <xref target="TS38.214"/> in cloud-gaming over Tencent's China Mobile LTE network. MCS information was provided directly to the applciation. Data was collected over several network conditions: 1&#41; low bandwhich, 2&#41; high user load, 3-5&#41; random user distributions. Lagging rate is defined as the ratio between the number of frames with transmission delay greater than 200ms and the total number of frames.

      It is noted that the more real-time network resource status the application can learn, the better it can predict how much network resource it can use within a prediction time window. However, there is tradeoff between network information collection frequency and its load and feasibility to the network devices. In principle, the total network resource consumed for such network status reporting is also designed in light-weight manner, e.g., by properly controlling the interval of report and also the number of bits needed to convey the reported information elements. In our experiments, the network status information can be obtained in an adaptive interval based on the change rate of network status, in order to provide good prediction with less load introduced in the network. In fact, not all scenarios need a very frequent information collection. If some information only changes in a very small range and won't influence the final decision, it is unnecessary to report such information all the time. However, if its value varies over the preset threshold, it will inform the application immediately.

      The distribution and impact of the exposed data to the performance gain for different algorithm needs to be further studied. This draft is to give a guidance to figure out what kind of data needs to be exposed during initial deployment of these mechanisms.
   </t>
   </section>

<section title="Standardization Considerations of MoWIE as an Extension to ALTO" anchor="sect-4">
<t>
    In 3GPP, network information exposure based on control plane mechanism is introduced in 4G and 5G systems.
    In 3GPP Release 17, there is a work item named 5G_AIS (Advanced Interactive Services) which focuses on
    QoS enhancements for interactive services including cloud gaming, XR, remote driving and real-time digital
    twin. There is also continuous work in Release 18 XRM (XR and media services), which focuses on strengthening the
    interaction and collaboration between applications and networks by improving the ability of the network information
    exposure especially for XR and multimedia services. MoWIE is closedly related to this study as it can be a tool to
    support exposure of 5G network status information. MoWIE can also support QoS prediction technologies which is
    being applied to 5G-enabled automated driving which is being developed in 5GAA <xref target="PQoS_white_paper"/>
, this solution can use network
    information exposure to predict the future network changes to the application layer in order to be prepared for such
    changes and make adaptations in application layer to improve the QoE of users.
    There have been close collaboration between 5GAA and 3GPP to provide E2E solutions on this area.</t>

<t>
    Among these above mentioned work items,
    one important way to support QoS (MoWIE and PQoS) enhancements is to expose the network status information to the application layer
    and the application layer can take measures to adapt according to the network status information. The network information
    can include the radio network statistics as has been elaborated in Section 4.1 and also the parameters specified
    in <xref target="ALTO_METRICS"/>
. In Section 4.1, the parameters which MoWIE proposes to expose can provide real-time status
    and rich information about the wireless link which can be utilized by AI-ML (Machine Learning) algorithms
    to predict the available network resources in the subsequent transmission opportunities, which can help the
    application layer to adjust its traffic pattern or codec profile to optimize the user’s experience.
    By mapping these parameters with the ALTO metrics which has been proposed or defining potential new ALTO metrics,
    it is possible to extent current ALTO protocols to provide better support for real-time immersive services.
    In ETSI MEC, RNIS <xref target="ETSI_MEC"/>
 has proposed to expose physical layer, Layer 2 and higher layer
    parameters including 4G and 5G. There are some common parameters like RSRP, RSRQ and RSSI which MoWIE also proposes;
    however, RNIS is based on the MEC architecture, and MoWIE is not restricted to MEC case.</t>

<t>
   It should be noticed that the previous mechanisms may also work on
   IEEE 802.11 standards (e.g., EHT), helping SP to have a better
   understanding for the network environment between AP and STAs.  Based
   on the fact that 802.11 devices are working on unlicensed spectrums,
   and easily influenced by adjacent unlicensed devices, duty cycles and
   related CQI information (e.g., MCS, and bandwidth) are considered very important network information here.
   Standardization Considerations of MoWIE as an Extension to ALTO MoWIE can be a
   realistic, important extension to ALTO to serve the aforementioned
   use cases, in the setting of the newer generation (5G) of cellular
   network, which is a completely open IP based network where routers/
   UPF with IP connectivity will be deployed much closer to the users.
   One may consider not only the aforementioned cloud-based multimedia
   applications, but also other latency sensitive applications such as
   connected vehicles and automotive driving.</t>

<t>
   Extending ALTO with MoWIE, therefore, may allow ALTO to expose lower
   layer network information to ensure higher application QoE for a wide
   spectrum of applications.</t>

<t>
   One possible approach to standardizing the distribution of the
   network information used in the evaluations is to send such
   information as piggyback information in the data path.  One issue with
   data path method is that MoWIE intends to convey more complex and rich
   information than current methods.  To piggyback such complex and rich
   information in the data path will consume significant data path
   resource.  But the data path-based method can provide frequently changed
   network information and it is technically simpler to synchronize the network
   information and user data at the same time scale. Normally, there is
   less user data in the uplink direction and the free "space"
   within the MTU can be used to piggyback the network information to
   the application, without the additional overhead of creating a second
   communication channel between the application and network.  However,
   the data path design may bring out more limited privacy management,
   which is very important in MoWIE.  The application cannot trust the
   network information if there is no message authentication mechanism
   for the piggyback network information.  How the network inserts the
   network information in the data packet is also challengeable since a
   lot of transport layer protocol are encrypted and integration
   protected.  Another method is to create an associated path aligned
   with data path.  Like the ICMP for IP and RTCP for RTP, this second
   path can be used to provide additional information associated with
   the data path.  But creating such second path is a big change to
   current widely used transport protocols and a lot of applications
   also need to change, this second path is also challengeable.</t>


<t>In this draft, we mainly discuss ALTO extension-based design in tackling with this problem.	
    Specifically, the MoWIE extension will reuse existing ALTO mechanisms including
    information resource directory, extensible performance metrics and calendaring, and unified properties.
    Below is an overview of key considerations; security
   considerations are in the following section.</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Network information selection and binding consideration: Instead
      of hardcoding only specific network information, a modular design
      of MoWIE is an ability for an ALTO client to select only the
      relevant information (e.g., cell DLOccupyPRBNum metric and UE MCS)
      and then request correspondingly.  Existing ALTO information
      resource directory is a starting point, but the design needs to be
      generic," to provide abstraction for ease of use and extensibility.  The security mechanisms of the existing ALTO protocol should also be extended to enforce proper authorization.</t>

<t>Compact network information encoding considerations: One benefit of
      ALTO is its high-level JSON based encoding.  When the update
      frequency increases, the existing base protocol and existing
      extensions (in particular the SSE extension), however, may have
      high bandwidth and processing overhead.  Hence, encoding and
      processing overhead of MoWIE should be considered.</t>

<t>Stability and reliability considerations: A key benefit of the
      MoWIE extension is the ability to allow more flexible, better
      coordinated control.  Any control mechanism, however, should
      integrate fundamental overhead, stability, and reliability
      mechanisms.</t>

<t>Cost metrics considerations. In <xref target="ALTO_METRICS"/>
, some cost metrics are
        being standardized including throughput/bit rate, latency, priority, error rate,
        jitter. These parameters can be linked with cost metrics in 5G network entities like network
        exposure function (NEF) <xref target="TS23.501"/>
        or application function (AF) <xref target="TS23.501"/>
.
        NEF or AF, which act as ALTO Clients, utilizing the network information exposure
        capability provided by 3GPP standards, can request to expose some of the proposed parameters with
        consideration of the ALTO performance metrics.</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>With the better utilization of the 5G network, IETF ALTO can well benefit from MoWIE architecture and
   QoE for the use cases of NAA applications can be achieved with the help of the convergence of 5G network
   architecture and IETF ALTO. For example, it was shown in Figure 5-1 that the ALTO client can act as AF or
   act as part of the functional module of AF to converge with the 5G system through the implementation in the AF.
   It can receive the cellular-based network information through interaction with NEF, identify the ALTO server
   using ALTO service discovery, and request available ALTO information prepared by the ALTO server using ALTO
   Protocol <xref target="RFC7285"/>
. The ALTO server can be implemented in other places through ALTO architecture and can interact
   with the third parties (e.g. Content providers) via external interfaces. Furthermore, the ALTO server can aggregate
   information from multiple functional entities to provide an abstract and unified view that can be more useful to
   applications. Examples of other systems include (but are not limited to) static network configuration databases,
   dynamic network information, routing protocols, provisioning policies, and interfaces to outside parties <xref target="RFC7285"/>
.
   Please note that these components shown in Figure 5-1 are out of IETF ALTO scope and are just for completeness to put here.
   As a result, the ALTO Client can perform ALTO Service Discovery and interact with the ALTO server via ALTO Protocol to get
   the ALTO information and ALTO metrics regarding the proposed parameters with the help of MoWIE that can be updated dynamically
   based on network conditions from cellular aspects in Section 4.1.  It is noted that in addition to AF-based convergence
   architecture which relies on control-plane interfaces e.g. N5/N33, MoWIE can also utilized user plane exposure via N6 or UPF
   which makes network exposure mechanisms more comprehensive and flexisble.

   The collection, distribution of MoWIE information should consider the
   security requirements on information privacy and information
   integration protection and authentication in both sides.  Since the
   network status is not directly related to any special user, there is
   currently no any privacy issue.  But the information transmitted to
   the application can pass through a lot of middle box and can be
   changed by the man in the middle.  To protect the network
   information, an end to end encryption and integration is needed.
   Also, the network needs to authenticate the information exposure
   provided to right applications.  These security requirements can be
   implemented by the TLS and other security mechanisms.</t>
